Calculate the new amount of provisions: When 200 more men join, the total number of men becomes 1000. We can calculate the new amount of provisions as follows:\n\n1000 men x n days = 12,000 man-days\n\nwhere n is the number of days the provisions will last for the new group of 1000 men.\n\n4. Solve for n: We can simplify the equation as follows:\n\nn = 12,000 man-days / 1000 men = 12 days\n\nTherefore, the provisions will last for 12 days when 200 more men join.\n\n5. Check the answer: We can check our answer by verifying that the total amount of provisions is the same for both groups:\n\n800 men x 15 days = 12,000 man-days\n1000 men x 12 days = 12,000 man-days\n\nTherefore, the answer is e.\nAnswer: e",

Therefore, we can use the fact that the provisions last for 15 days with 900 men to find the daily consumption:\n\nDaily consumption = Provisions / (900 x 15) = 13500 / 13500 = 1\n\nNow we can use this daily consumption to find the new number of days:\n\nNumber of days = Provisions / (1100 x 1) = 13500 / 1100 = 12.27\n\nTherefore, the answer is e.\nAnswer: e",
