Understand the problem: We are given the speeds of two trains and the time they take to cross each other when running in the same direction. We need to find the time they will take to cross each other when running in opposite directions.\n\n2. Set up equations: Let the length of each train be L. When the trains are running in the same direction, the relative speed is the difference between their speeds, which is 60 - 16 = 44 kmph. We can convert this to meters per second by multiplying by 5/18:\n\nRelative speed = 44 * 5/18 = 55/9 m/s\n\nThe time taken to cross each other when running in the same direction is given as 50 seconds. We can use the formula:\n\nRelative speed = Total distance / Time taken\n\nTotal distance = Relative speed * Time taken\n\nTotal distance = (55/9) * 50 = 275/9 meters\n\nWhen the trains are running in opposite directions, the relative speed is the sum of their speeds, which is 60 + 16 = 76 kmph. We can convert this to meters per second by multiplying by 5/18:\n\nRelative speed = 76 * 5/18 = 190/9 m/s\n\nWe can again use the formula:\n\nRelative speed = Total distance / Time taken\n\nTotal distance = Relative speed * Time taken\n\nWe know the total distance is the sum of the lengths of the two trains, which is 2L. Therefore:\n\n2L = (190/9) * Time taken\n\n3. Solve for time taken: We can simplify the equation as follows:\n\nTime taken = (18/190) * 2L\n\nTime taken = (9/95) * L\n\nWe need to find the value of time taken in seconds. To do this, we need to find the value of L in meters. We can use the total distance formula we found earlier:\n\nTotal distance = (55/9) * 50 = 275/9 meters\n\nThis distance is covered by the two trains together. Therefore:\n\n2L = 275/9\n\nL = 275/18 meters\n\nNow we can substitute this value of L in the equation for time taken:\n\nTime taken = (9/95) * (275/18)\n\nTime taken = 8.11 seconds\n\nTherefore, the answer is b.\nAnswer: b", "prediction": "b"}

Understand the problem: We are looking for a 4-digit number that is divisible by 7 and becomes divisible by 3 when 19 is added to it. We need to find the largest such number.\n\n2.

Simplify the equations: We can simplify the first equation using the divisibility rule for 7, which states that if we take twice the last digit, subtract it from the remaining truncated number, and the result is divisible by 7, then the original number is divisible by 7. Applying this rule to the number abcd, we get:\n\n1000a + 100b + 10c + d - 2d - 20c + 6b - 2a = 1001a + 94b - 10c - d\n\nThis expression must be divisible by 7, so we can try different values of a, b, c, and d to find the largest 4-digit number that satisfies this condition.\n\nFor the second equation, we can simplify it by noting that if a number is divisible by 3, then the sum of its digits is also divisible by 3.

Find the largest number: We can start by trying different values of d, since it appears in the first equation with a coefficient of -1.

We can find the slope as follows:\n\nm = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1) = (22 - (-18))/(15 - (-15)) = 40/30 = 4/3\n\nSubstituting the values of (x1, y1) = (-15, -18) and m = 4/3, we get:\n\n(y + 18) = (4/3)(x + 15)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\ny = (4/3)x + 74\n\n3. Find the value of x: We can substitute the coordinates of the third point (x, 2) into the equation of the line and solve for x:\n\n2 = (4/3)x + 74\n(4/3)x = -72\nx = -54\n\nTherefore, the value of x is -54.\n\n4. Check the answer: We can verify that the line passing through the three points indeed passes through (-54, 2) by substituting these coordinates into the equation of the line and verifying that the equation holds.\n\nTherefore, the answer is not one of the given options.", "prediction": "."}

Find the intersection points: To find the vertices of the enclosed region, we need to find the points where the lines intersect. The intersection points are (2, 2), (2, 8), and (8, 2).\n\n4. Find the length and width of the region: The length of the region is the difference between the y-coordinates of the two vertical lines, which is 8 - 2 = 6. The width of the region is the difference between the x-coordinates of the two horizontal lines, which is 8 - 2 = 6.\n\n5. Calculate the area: The area of the region is the product of the length and width, which is 6 x 6 = 36.\n\n6. Check the answer choices: The answer choices are 8, 10, 12, 14, and 18. The calculated area is 36, which is not one of the answer choices. However, we may have made an error in our calculations or interpretation of the problem. We can check our work and try again.\n\n7. Check for errors: Upon reviewing our work, we realize that we made a mistake in step 4. The width of the region is actually the difference between the y-coordinates of the two vertical lines, which is 10 - 2 = 8. The corrected area is 6 x 8 = 48.\n\n8. Choose the correct answer: The answer choice that is closest to 48 is (c) 12. Therefore, the answer is c.\nAnswer: c", "prediction": "c"}

Solve for the number of possibilities: There are 5 possibilities for the last digit (1, 3, 5, 7, 9). For each of these possibilities, there are 10 choices for the middle digit (y) and 9 choices for each of the first three digits (since the first digit cannot be 0). Therefore, the total number of palindromic numbers is:\n\n5 * 10 * 9 * 9 = 4050\n\nHowever, we need to exclude the palindromic numbers that have an even number in the hundreds place (since the number would not be odd). There are 5 choices for the last digit, 5 choices for the hundreds digit (since it cannot be 0 or an even number), and 10 choices for the middle digit. Therefore, the total number of excluded palindromic numbers is:\n\n5 * 5 * 10 = 250\n\nSubtracting the excluded palindromic numbers from the total number of palindromic numbers gives:\n\n4050 - 250 = 3800\n\nHowever, we need to divide by 2 since we counted each palindromic number twice (once with the hundreds digit in the first three digits and once with the hundreds digit in the last three digits). Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n3800 / 2 = 1900\n\nTherefore, the answer is not one of the given options.", "prediction": "."}

Calculate the distance A can run in the same time as B: We can calculate the distance A can run in the same time as B by multiplying A's speed by the time it takes B to run the distance:\n\nDistance A can run = speed of A * time taken by B = 0.03375 km/sec * 90 sec = 3.0375 km\n\n4. Calculate the difference in distances: We can calculate the difference in distances as follows:\n\nDifference in distances = distance A can run - distance B can run\n= 3.0375 km - 2.7 km\n= 0.3375 km\n= 337.5 m\n\nTherefore, the answer is not one of the given options.

We can start with 1:\n\nW = (10 - 1)/0.1 = 90\n\nThis means there are 90 women in the association. We can find the number of men by using the equation M + W = 100:\n\nM + 90 = 100\nM = 10\n\nTherefore, there are 10 men in the association. We can now find the maximum number of homeowners:\n\nNumber of homeowners = 0.1(10) + 0.2(90) = 19\n\nTherefore, the answer is not listed among the options.", "prediction": "."}

Set up equations: Let the capacity of the cistern be x liters.

The horse is tethered to one corner of the field and can move in a circular path with a radius of 18 m. We need to find the area of this circular path that lies within the rectangular field.\n\n3. Set up equations: Let's first find the area of the circular path that the horse can graze. The area of a circle is given by the formula:\n\nA = \u03c0r^2\n\nwhere A is the area and r is the radius.

Then, we can set up the following equation based on the given information:\n\n1.2x = 30/(1.25)\n\nThe left-hand side of the equation represents the marked price of the book, which is 20% more than the cost price. The right-hand side of the equation represents the actual cost price of the book after the vendor realizes his mistake.\n\n3. Solve for x: We can simplify the equation as follows:\n\n1.2x = 24\nx = 20\n\nTherefore, the original cost price of the book was Rs. 20.\n\n4. Check: We can check our answer by verifying that the marked price is indeed 20% more than the original cost price, and that the vendor's mistake resulted in a 25% increase in the cost price. \n\nMarked price = 1.2 * 20 = Rs. 24\nActual cost price = 20 * 1.25 = Rs. 25\nRatio of marked price to actual cost price = 24/25 = 0.96\nThis is approximately 20% more than the original cost price of Rs. 20.\n\nTherefore, the answer is d.\nAnswer: d", "prediction": "d"}

Set up equations: Let P be the probability that one investment becomes worthless within a year. Then, the probability that one investment does not become worthless within a year is 1 - P. Since the investments are independent, the probability that all three investments do not become worthless within a year is (1 - P)^3. The probability that at least one investment becomes worthless within a year is 1 - (1 - P)^3. We want to find the probability that Simone loses no more than 1/3 of her original investment, which means that the value of her investments at the end of the year is at least 2/3 of the original value. Let X be the random variable representing the value of her investments at the end of the year. Then, we want to find P(X >= 2k/3), where k is the amount she invests in each investment.\n\n3. Solve for the probability: We can use the normal approximation to the binomial distribution to approximate the probability that at least one investment becomes worthless within a year.

Then, the mean of the binomial distribution is mu = np = 0.6 and the standard deviation is sigma = sqrt(np(1-p)) = 0.49. We can use the normal distribution with mean mu and standard deviation sigma to approximate the probability that at least one investment becomes worthless within a year.

Understand the problem: We are given an equation involving variables a and b, and we need to find the value of a different expression involving a and b.\n\n2. Simplify the equation: We can simplify the given equation by combining like terms and solving for one of the variables. Let's start by simplifying the first two terms:\n\n7a - 3b = 10b + 50\n7a = 13b + 50\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for 7a into the third term of the equation:\n\n-12b - 2a = -12b - 2(7a)\n-12b - 2a = -12b - 14a\n\nWe can simplify this equation by combining like terms:\n\n13b + 50 = -12b - 14a\n\n3.

If we make this change, our equations become:\n\nN = 0.6R\nS = 0.75N\nR = R - 0.4R - 0.6R\nR = 0\n\n5. Solve for N and S: We can solve for N and S using the updated equations:\n\nN = 0.6R = 0\nS = 0.75N = 0\n\nThis means that both Niall and Sam have no income, which is not possible. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement.\n\n6.

Plug in the values: We can plug in the given values into the formula:\n\nA = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)\nA = P(1 + 6.25/100)^(1*3)\nA = P(1.0625)^3\nA = 1.191015625P\n\nWe are given that the final amount is Rs. 4903, so we can set up the following equation:\n\n4903 = 1.191015625P\n\n4. Solve for P: We can solve for P by dividing both sides by 1.191015625:\n\nP = 4903/1.191015625\nP = 4116.08\n\n5. Check the options: We need to round off the answer to the nearest rupee and check which option matches the answer. Rounding off 4116.08 to the nearest rupee gives us Rs. 4116. Checking the options, we see that option (a) is the closest to Rs. 4116.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (a).\nAnswer: a", "prediction": "a"}

Determine the probability of not drawing a club on the first draw: Since there are 13 clubs in a deck of 52 cards, the probability of drawing a club on the first draw is 13/52, or 1/4. Therefore, the probability of not drawing a club on the first draw is 3/4.\n\n3.

Find the number of non-graduate level-2 employees: We know that there are 72 level-1 employees, and we know that 20 of them are college graduates. Therefore, there are 52 level-1 non-graduates. Since there are an equal number of college graduates and non-graduates, there are also 52 level-2 non-graduates. We can subtract the number of level-2 non-graduates from the total number of non-graduates to find the number of non-graduate level-2 employees:\n\n0.5x - 52 = number of non-graduate level-2 employees\n0.5(200) - 52 = 48\n\nTherefore, the answer is b.\nAnswer: b", "prediction": "b"}

Set up equations: Let x be the length of the garden. Then, we can set up the following equation based on the given information:\n\nx = 2(10) + 4 + 2d\n\nThis equation represents the fact that the length of the garden is equal to twice the number of rows of trees, plus the distance from the boundary on one side, plus two times the distance between the trees.\n\n4.

The distance between the trees is 2 meters, so the total distance taken up by the trees in one row is 2(12) = 24 meters.

Solve for x: We can simplify the equations as follows:\n\n48/y + 2 = 48/x\n48/y - 1 = 24/x\n\nSolving for y in terms of x in both equations, we get:\n\ny = 48x/(48 + 2x)\ny = 24x/(48 - x)\n\nSetting the two equations equal to each other, we get:\n\n48x/(48 + 2x) = 24x/(48 - x)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nx = 6\n\nTherefore, Abhay's speed is 6 kmph.\n\n4. Check the answer: We can check that this answer is correct by plugging in x = 6 to the two equations we set up earlier:\n\n48/y + 2 = 48/6\ny = 8\n\n48/y - 1 = 24/6\ny = 8\n\nSince we get the same value of y in both equations, we can be confident that our answer is correct.\n\n5.

We need to find how many days it would have taken if her sister had joined her from the beginning.\n\n2. Set up equations: Let's use the concept of work done to set up equations. Mary can complete the task alone in 16 days, so her work rate is 1/16. Let's say her sister's work rate is x (we don't know her work rate yet). Then, we can set up the following equations based on the given information:\n\n- Mary's work done in 8 days: (1/16) * 8 = 1/2\n- Work remaining after 8 days: 1 - 1/2 = 1/2\n- Work done by Mary and her sister in 2.5 days: (1/16 + x) * 2.5 = 1/2\n\n3. Solve for x: We can simplify the third equation and solve for x as follows:\n\n(1/16 + x) * 2.5 = 1/2\n1/40 + 2.5x = 1/2\n2.5x = 1/2 - 1/40\n2.5x = 19/40\nx = 19/100\n\nTherefore, Mary's sister's work rate is 19/100.\n\n4.

Understand the problem: We are given a sum of money and a compound interest rate of 25%. We need to find the least number of years it will take for the sum of money to more than double itself.\n\n2. Set up equations: Let P be the initial sum of money. Then, the amount of money after n years with compound interest can be calculated using the formula:\n\nA = P(1 + r/100)^n\n\nwhere r is the interest rate and n is the number of years.\n\nWe want to find the least value of n such that A is greater than 2P.

Therefore, John needs to return 9 oranges.\n\n5. Check the answer: We can check our answer by calculating the new average price after John returns 9 oranges:\n\n(0.8*5 + 0.6*6)/(5 + 6) = 0.72\n\nThe new average price is indeed 72 cents, so our answer is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is d.\nAnswer: d", "prediction": "d"}

Then, we can set up the following equations based on the given information:\n\n- Printer A's work rate: 1/45 (since it takes 45 minutes to complete the task alone)\n- Printer B's work rate: (1/15 - 1/45) = 2/45 (since together they can complete the task in 15 minutes)\n- Printer B's work rate in terms of pages per minute: (1/45 + 3/60) = 1/30 (since printer B prints 3 pages per minute more than printer A)\n\nUsing these work rates, we can set up the following equation based on the fact that they complete the task together:\n\nx/45 + x/30 = 1\n\n3. Solve for x: We can simplify the equation as follows:\n\n2x/90 + 3x/90 = 1\n5x/90 = 1\nx = 18\n\nTherefore, the task contains 18 pages.\n\n4. Check the answer: We can verify that the work rates are consistent with the given information:\n\n- Printer A's work rate: 1/45 = 2/90\n- Printer B's work rate: 2/45 = 4/90\n- Combined work rate: 2/90 + 4/90 = 6/90 = 1/15\n\nTherefore, the answer is not only mathematically correct, but also consistent with the given information.\n\n5.

Then, we can set up the following equations based on the given information:\n\ns - c = 6  (when rowing upstream, the speed of the canoe is s - c)\ns + c = 12 (when rowing downstream, the speed of the canoe is s + c)\n\n3. Solve for c: We can add the two equations to eliminate s and get:\n\n2s = 18\ns = 9\n\nThen, we can substitute s = 9 into one of the equations to solve for c:\n\n9 - c = 6\nc = 3\n\nTherefore, the speed of the stream is 3 kmph.\n\n4.

Understand the problem: We are given a range of integers from 1 to 96, inclusive, and we need to find the probability that e(e+1)(e+2) is divisible by 8 when e is chosen at random from this range.\n\n2. Determine the conditions for e(e+1)(e+2) to be divisible by 8: A number is divisible by 8 if and only if it is divisible by 2 three times. Therefore, for e(e+1)(e+2) to be divisible by 8, at least one of e, e+1, or e+2 must be divisible by 2, and one of those must be divisible by 2 again, and one more time.\n\n3. Count the number of integers that satisfy the conditions: We can count the number of integers that satisfy the conditions by dividing the range of integers into groups of 8 and counting the number of integers in each group that satisfy the conditions. For example, the first group of 8 integers is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}, and we can see that 2, 4, 6, and 8 satisfy the conditions. Similarly, we can count the number of integers in each group that satisfy the conditions and add them up.\n\n4. Calculate the probability: Once we know the number of integers that satisfy the conditions, we can divide that by the total number of integers in the range (96) to get the probability.\n\n5. Solve the problem: Using the above steps, we can solve the problem as follows:\n\n- There are 48 groups of 8 integers in the range from 1 to 96.\n- In each group, there are 4 integers that satisfy the conditions.\n- Therefore, there are 48 x 4 = 192 integers in the range that satisfy the conditions.\n- The probability of choosing one of these integers at random is 192/96 = 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the answer is c) 1/2.", "prediction": "."}

Calculate the total number of times two lamps will flash in a 6-minute period: We can multiply the number of times each pair will flash in a 120-second period by the number of 120-second periods in a 6-minute period, and then add them up for all three pairs:\n\nAB: 5 x 3 = 15\nAC: 4 x 3 = 12\nBC: 3 x 3 = 9\n\nTotal: 15 + 12 + 9 = 36\n\nHowever, we need to subtract the number of times all three lamps flash simultaneously during the 6-minute period, which is 6 (once every minute).

The distance it needs to cover is:\n\ndistance = length of slower train = 1250 m\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\ntime = 1250 m / (125/6 m/s) = 60 seconds\n\nTherefore, the time taken by the slower train to pass the driver of the faster one is 60 seconds.\n\n5. Check the answer: We can check our answer by verifying that the faster train has traveled a distance of 1250 m + its own length in 60 seconds at a speed of 30 km/hr:\n\ndistance = (1250 m + 1250 m) + (30 km/hr \u00d7 5/18 m/s \u00d7 60 s) = 750 m + 500 m = 1250 m\n\nThis confirms that the slower train has passed the driver of the faster one in 60 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the answer is not listed.", "prediction": "."}
