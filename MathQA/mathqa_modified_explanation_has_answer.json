Then, we can set up the following equations based on the given information:\n\nSelling price with discount = 0.95x\nProfit with discount = 0.311x\n\n3. Solve for x: We can solve for x by using the formula for profit percentage:\n\nProfit percentage = (selling price - cost price) / cost price * 100\n\nUsing the given information, we can set up the following equation:\n\n0.311x / x * 100 = 31.1\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n0.311 * 100 = 31.1\n\nTherefore, the cost price of the article is $100.\n\n4. Calculate the selling price without discount: We can calculate the selling price without discount as follows:\n\nSelling price without discount = cost price + profit\nSelling price without discount = $100 + 31.1% of $100\nSelling price without discount = $100 + $31.10\nSelling price without discount = $131.10\n\n5. Calculate the profit percentage without discount: We can calculate the profit percentage without discount using the formula:\n\nProfit percentage = (selling price - cost price) / cost price * 100\n\nUsing the values we calculated, we get:\n\nProfit percentage = ($131.10 - $100) / $100 * 100\nProfit percentage = 31.1%\n\nTherefore, the answer is c.\nAnswer: c",

Determine the rates of work: We can determine the rates of work for each consultant by dividing the amount of work by the time it takes to complete the work:\n\nRate of work for consultant 1 = 1/12.5 (typing)\nRate of work for consultant 2 = 1/7.5 (editing)\n\n3. Determine the amount of work: We can determine the amount of work required to complete the report by adding the amount of work required for typing and editing:\n\nAmount of work = 1/12.5 + 1/7.5 = 0.16 + 0.133 = 0.293\n\n4. Determine the amount of work done by Jim: We can determine the amount of work done by Jim in t hours by multiplying his rate of work by t:\n\nAmount of work done by Jim = (1/12.5) * t = 0.08t\n\n5. Determine the amount of work left for Mary: We can determine the amount of work left for Mary to complete by subtracting the amount of work done by Jim from the total amount of work:\n\nAmount of work left for Mary = 0.293 - 0.08t\n\n6. Set up an equation: We can set up an equation based on the amount of work left for Mary and her rate of work:\n\n(1/7.5) * (t + 30) = Amount of work left for Mary / (1/12.5)\n\nThis equation represents the fact that Mary completes the remaining work in t + 30 hours and her rate of work is 1/7.5.\n\n7.

Let L be the length of the smallest size, then the length of the largest size is 1.3L.\n\n3. Determine the length increase per size: We are told that each unit increase in size corresponds to a 1/5-inch increase in length. Therefore, the length increase per size is 1/5 inch.\n\n4. Determine the length of the shoe in size 15: We can use the information from steps 2 and 3 to determine the length of the shoe in size 15. Size 15 is 7 sizes larger than size 8, so the length increase is 7 times the length increase per size:\n\nLength increase = 7 x 1/5 inch = 1.4 inches\n\nTherefore, the length of the shoe in size 15 is:\n\nL + 1.4 inches\n\nWe can also use the information from step 2 to express this in terms of L:\n\nL + 1.4 inches = 1.3L\n\n0.3L = 1.4 inches\n\nL = 4.67 inches\n\nTherefore, the length of the shoe in size 15 is:\n\n4.67 + 1.4 = 6.8 inches\n\nTherefore, the answer is a.\nAnswer: a",

Solve for n: We can substitute the first equation into the second equation and solve for n:\n\nk/n = (nq + 11)/n = q + 11/n = 81.1\n\nq + 11/n = 81.1\nq/n = 81 - 11/n\nq/n = (70n - 11)/n\n\nSince q/n is an integer, (70n - 11) must be divisible by n. The only factors of 11 are 1 and 11, so n can only be 1 less than a multiple of 70. The possible values of n are 1, 69, and 139.\n\nWe can check each value of n by dividing k by n and verifying that the remainder is indeed 11:\n\nFor n = 1, k/n = 811, which does not have a remainder of 11.\nFor n = 69, k/n = 11.9 with a remainder of 11.\nFor n = 139, k/n = 5.85, which does not have a remainder of 11.\n\nTherefore, the answer is c.\nAnswer: c",

First, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to eliminate F:\n\nJ = 2(F - 4)\nJ = 2S\n\nThen, we can substitute the second equation into the third equation to eliminate S:\n\nJ - 4 = 8(F - 8)\nJ - 4 = 8S\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables:\n\nJ = 2S\nJ - 4 = 8S\n\nWe can solve for S in the first equation and substitute into the second equation:\n\nS = J/2\nJ - 4 = 8(J/2)\nJ - 4 = 4J\n3J = 4 + 4\nJ = 8\n\nTherefore, Jim is currently 8 years old.\n\n4. Check the answer: We can check our answer by verifying that the other ages make sense:\n\nF = S + 4 = 8 + 4 = 12\nS = F - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8\n\nThese ages are consistent with the given information, so our answer is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is a.\nAnswer: a",

Substitute the total profit into the equation for B: We can substitute the expression for the total profit into the equation for B:\n\nB = (5 x (840 + (4900 + 3B)/5) - 9100)/3\n\n7. Solve for B: We can simplify and solve the equation as follows:\n\nB = 9228\n\nTherefore, the answer is a.\nAnswer: a",

Determine the concentration of milk after the second replacement: We can use the same formula for concentration of a mixture to determine the concentration of milk after the second replacement:\n\n0.25 = (30.25 - x)/100 * (100 - x)^2 + x/100 * (100 - x)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n0.25(100 - x)^2 + 100x - x^2 = 3025 - 30.25x\n\n0.25x^2 - 2.5x + 625 = 0\n\nx^2 - 10x + 2500 = 0\n\n(x - 5)^2 = 25\n\nx = 5 or x = 15\n\n5. Determine the value of x: We need to choose the value of x that satisfies the conditions of the problem. If we choose x = 5, then the concentration of milk after the first replacement would be negative, which is not possible. Therefore, we choose x = 15.\n\nTherefore, the answer is d.\nAnswer: d",

Determine the filling and emptying rates: Let the filling rate be F and the emptying rate be E. Then, we can determine the rates as follows:\n\nF = 1/5 (since the cistern can be filled in 5 hours)\nE = -1/10 (since the cistern can be emptied in 10 hours)\n\nNote that the emptying rate is negative because it represents a decrease in the amount of water in the cistern.\n\n3. Determine the net rate of filling: The net rate of filling is the difference between the filling and emptying rates:\n\nNet rate of filling = F + E = 1/5 - 1/10 = 1/10\n\n4. Determine the time to fill the cistern: We can use the formula:\n\nTime = Amount of work / Rate of work\n\nSince the cistern is being filled, the amount of work is 1 (i.e. filling the cistern completely).

Therefore, we can use the fact that the provisions last for 15 days with 900 men to find the daily consumption:\n\nDaily consumption = Provisions / (900 x 15) = 13500 / 13500 = 1\n\nNow we can use this daily consumption to find the new number of days:\n\nNumber of days = Provisions / (1100 x 1) = 13500 / 1100 = 12.27\n\nTherefore, the answer is e.\nAnswer: e",

Understand the problem: We are given information about the time it takes for two trains to cross a man on a platform and the time it takes for them to cross each other.

Then, we can set up the following equations based on the given information:\n\n(x + y) * 27 = d\n(x + y) * 17 = d\n(x + y) * 23 = 2d\n\nwhere d is the distance between the trains.\n\n3.

Understand the problem: We are given information about Sarah's lemonade stand, including the price of a cup of lemonade on hot days and regular days, the cost per cup, and the total profit over a two week period. We need to find the price of a cup on a hot day.\n\n2. Calculate the total revenue: We can calculate the total revenue by multiplying the number of cups sold each day by the price per cup:\n\nRegular days revenue = 32 cups/day x $1.00/cup x 10 days = $320\nHot days revenue = 32 cups/day x $1.25/cup x 3 days = $120\n\nTotal revenue = $320 + $120 = $440\n\n3. Calculate the total cost: We can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of cups sold each day by the cost per cup:\n\nTotal cost = 32 cups/day x $0.75/cup x 14 days = $336\n\n4. Calculate the profit: We can calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:\n\nProfit = $440 - $336 = $104\n\n5. Calculate the profit on hot days: We can calculate the profit on hot days by subtracting the revenue on hot days from the total profit:\n\nProfit on hot days = $104 - $120 = -$16\n\nThis means that Sarah lost money on hot days, so the price of a cup on hot days must be less than $1.25.\n\n6. Calculate the price of a cup on regular days: We can calculate the price of a cup on regular days by dividing the regular days revenue by the number of cups sold:\n\nPrice per cup on regular days = $320 / (32 cups/day x 10 days) = $1.00/cup\n\n7. Calculate the price of a cup on hot days: We can use the fact that the price on hot days is 25% higher than the price on regular days to set up the following equation:\n\n$1.00 + 0.25($1.00) = $1.25\n\nTherefore, the answer is a.\nAnswer: a",

Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem: We can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to find a solution for k that satisfies both conditions:\n\nk \u2261 2 (mod 5)\nk \u2261 5 (mod 6)\n\nTo solve this system of congruences, we can use the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Find a solution for k \u2261 2 (mod 5). Since k is less than 24, the possible solutions are 2, 7, 12, 17, and 22. However, we can eliminate 7 and 17 as solutions because they are not congruent to 5 (mod 6). Therefore, the possible solutions are 2, 12, and 22.\n\nStep 2: Check each possible solution to see if it satisfies the second congruence. We can do this by checking if the solution leaves a remainder of 5 when divided by 6. Only 12 satisfies this condition.\n\nTherefore, k \u2261 12 (mod 30) is a solution for the system of congruences.\n\n3. Find the remainder when k is divided by 7: To find the remainder when k is divided by 7, we can use the fact that k \u2261 12 (mod 30) and write:\n\nk = 30n + 12\n\nwhere n is an integer. Then, we can substitute this expression for k into the division algorithm:\n\nk = 7q + r\n\nwhere q is the quotient and r is the remainder. Substituting the expression for k, we get:\n\n30n + 12 = 7q + r\n\nSolving for r, we get:\n\nr = 30n + 12 - 7q\n\nSince k is less than 24, we can take n = 0 and q = 1 to get:\n\nr = 30(0) + 12 - 7(1) = 5\n\nTherefore, the remainder when k is divided by 7 is 5.\n\nTherefore, the answer is b.\nAnswer: b",

Check the answer: We can check our answer by verifying that the distances traveled by each car are equal at the time of the catch-up:\n\nDistance traveled by red car = 20(2/3) = 40/3 miles\nDistance traveled by black car = 50(2/3) = 100/3 miles\n\nDistance traveled by black car - Distance traveled by red car = (100/3) - (40/3) = 20 miles\n\nTherefore, the answer is a.\nAnswer: a",

Calculate the ratio of the width to the area: The width of the rectangle is 60 cm and the area is 4800 sq cm, so the ratio of the width to the area is:\n\nWidth : Area = 60 : 4800 = 1 : 80\n\nTherefore, the answer is c.\nAnswer: c",

Therefore, 48 is divisible by 3.\n\n3. Test for divisibility by 5: To test for divisibility by 5, we can check if the number ends in 0 or 5. In this case, 48 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.\n\n4.

We know that train A has a head start of 60 miles, so:\n\nd = rt + 60\n\nWe also know that the time it takes for train B to catch up to train A is the same as the time it takes for train A to travel the distance between them, so:\n\nt = d/30\n\nSubstituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:\n\nd = (5/6)d + 60\n\nSolving for d, we get:\n\nd = 300\n\nTherefore, the distance between the trains when train B overtakes train A is 300 miles.\n\n5. Check the answer: We can check our answer by verifying that the time it takes for train B to catch up to train A is 6 hours:\n\nt = d/30 = 300/30 = 10 hours\n\nThis is the same as the time it takes for train A to travel 360 miles (60 miles head start plus 300 miles between the trains) at 30 miles per hour:\n\nt = d/r = 360/30 = 12 hours\n\nTherefore, the answer is e.\nAnswer: e",

For example, we can solve for d in terms of c:\n\nd = 2c - 10\n\nThen, we can substitute this expression for d into the second equation:\n\n2(2c - 10) - 4c = -20\n4c - 20 - 4c = -20\n0 = 0\n\nThis equation is true for any value of c, which means that there are infinitely many solutions. However, we are only interested in the number of buffaloes, which is not affected by the number of ducks and cows.\n\n4. Find the total number of buffaloes: We can find the total number of buffaloes by subtracting the number of ducks and cows from the total number of heads:\n\nTotal number of buffaloes = (2(d + c + 1) + 4c + 4 - d - c) / 4\n= (2(d + c) + 6c + 6) / 4\n= (2(d + c) + 3c + 3) / 2\n= (2(2c - 10) + 3c + 3) / 2\n= (7c - 17) / 2\n\nSince the number of buffaloes must be a whole number, we can try different values of c until we find one that gives a whole number. For example, if c = 3, then the total number of heads is 2(3 + d) = 6 + 2d",

Solve for a^2 + b^2: We can use the equation a*b = 4 to solve for a+b in terms of a*b:\n\na*b = 4\na+b = a*b/(a-b) + a-b\na+b = 4/(a-b) + (a-b)\n\nThen, we can substitute this expression for a+b in the equation for a^4 + b^4:\n\na^4 + b^4 = 9(a^2 + b^2)/(4/(a-b) + (a-b)) + 32\n\n4. Simplify the expression: We can simplify the denominator by multiplying by (a-b):\n\na^4 + b^4 = 9(a^2 + b^2)/(4(a-b) + (a-b)^2) + 32\na^4 + b^4 = 9(a^2 + b^2)/(a^2 - 2ab + b^2 + 4) + 32\na^4 + b^4 = 9(a^2 + b^2)/(a^2 + 2ab + b^2 + 4ab) + 32\na^4 + b^4 = 9(a^2 + b",

Determine the previous remainder: We know that when n is divided by 19, the remainder is 7. Therefore, the previous remainder when (n-1) is divided by 19 would be 18.\n\n3. Determine the remainder when 18n is divided by 9: We can simplify 18n as 2 x 9 x n. Since 9 is a factor of 18, the remainder when 18n is divided by 9 would be the same as the remainder when 2n is divided by 9. We can find this remainder by adding the digits of 2n and finding the remainder when the sum is divided by 9. For example, if 2n = 46, then the sum of digits is 4+6=10, and the remainder when 10 is divided by 9 is 1.\n\n4. Find the difference between remainders: The difference between the previous remainder (18) and the remainder when 18n is divided by 9 would be:\n\n18 - remainder when 2n is divided by 9\n\n5. Solve for the remainder when 2n is divided by 9: We can't determine the exact value of 2n, but we know that the remainder when it is divided by 9 is one less than the remainder when 18n is divided by 9. Therefore, the difference between the previous remainder and the remainder when 18n is divided by 9 would be:\n\n18 - (remainder when 18n is divided by 9 + 1)\n\n6. Substitute values and solve: We know that the remainder when n is divided by 19 is 7, so we can substitute n = 19k + 7, where k is an integer. Then, we can simplify 18n as 18(19k+7) = 342k + 126. The remainder when 342k+126 is divided by 9 is 0, so the remainder when 18n is divided by 9 is 8. Therefore, the difference between the previous remainder and the remainder when 18n is divided by 9 would be:\n\n18 - (8+1) = 9\n\nTherefore, the answer is e.\nAnswer: e",

Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem: We can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to find a solution for n that satisfies both conditions. Let's start by finding a solution for the first condition:\n\nn \u2261 2 (mod 3)\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nn = 3k + 2\n\nwhere k is an integer. Now let's substitute this into the second condition:\n\n3k + 2 \u2261 1 (mod 4)\n\nWe can simplify this as:\n\n3k \u2261 3 (mod 4)\n\nMultiplying both sides by 3, we get:\n\n9k \u2261 9 (mod 4)\n\nSimplifying further, we get:\n\nk \u2261 1 (mod 4)\n\nSubstituting this back into the equation for n, we get:\n\nn = 3(4m + 1) + 2 = 12m + 5\n\nwhere m is an integer.\n\n3.

However, we can check the remainders for different values of m:\n\nm = 0: n mod 16 \u2261 5\nm = 1: n mod 16 \u2261 1\nm = 2: n mod 16 \u2261 13\nm = 3: n mod 16 \u2261 9\nm = 4: n mod 16 \u2261 5\n\nWe can see that the remainders repeat every 4 values of m.

Determine the time for the upstream journey: We can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nwhere the distance is the distance to the upstream point and the speed is the speed of the man relative to the water.

One way to do this is to start with the smallest possible integer for one of the numbers (123) and the largest possible integer for the other number (987) and then try different combinations of digits until we find the smallest possible difference. We can use the following table to keep track of the differences:\n\nn   m   difference\n123 987 864\n123 978 855\n123 897 774\n123 879 756\n123 798 675\n123 789 666\n132 987 855\n132 978 846\n132 897 765\n132 879 747\n132 798 666\n132 789 657\n\nThe smallest possible difference is 657, which occurs when n = 132 and m = 789.\n\nTherefore, the answer is e.\nAnswer: e",

Therefore, the position of the hour hand can be calculated as follows:\n\nPosition of hour hand = 8 x 30 + 0.4 x 30 = 240 + 12 = 252 degrees\n\n3. Calculate the position of the minute hand: At 8:24 pm, the minute hand is on the 4 on the clock face, which represents 120 degrees.\n\n4. Calculate the angle between the hands: The angle between the hands is the absolute difference between their positions, or the smaller angle between them if the difference is greater than 180 degrees. We can calculate the angle as follows:\n\nAngle between hands = |252 - 120| = 132 degrees\n\nSince 132 degrees is greater than 180 degrees, we need to subtract it from 360 degrees to get the smaller angle:\n\nSmaller angle between hands = 360 - 132 = 228 degrees\n\nTherefore, the answer is e) none of these, since none of the given options match the correct answer of 228 degrees.",

Determine the weight of each mineral in a cubic meter of sand: We can calculate the weight of each mineral in a cubic meter of sand by multiplying the volume of each mineral by its weight per cubic centimeter and converting to grams:\n\nWeight of mineral x = 0.4 m^3 x 100^3 cm^3/m^3 x 2.5 g/cm^3 = 100,000 g\nWeight of mineral y = 0.6 m^3 x 100^3 cm^3/m^3 x 4 g/cm^3 = 240,000 g\n\n4. Determine the total weight of the sand: We can determine the total weight of the sand by adding the weights of the two minerals:\n\nTotal weight of sand = 100,000 g + 240,000 g = 340,000 g\n\nTherefore, the answer is a.\nAnswer: a",

Solve for x and y: We can use the first equation to solve for y in terms of x:\n\ny = 160 - x\n\nWe can substitute this expression for y into the second equation to solve for z in terms of x:\n\nz = x + 100 = (160 - y) + 100 = 260 - y\n\n4. Find the average of y and z: We can find the average of y and z by adding them together and dividing by 2:\n\n(y + z) / 2 = (160 - x + 260 - y) / 2 = (420 - x - y) / 2\n\nWe can substitute the expression for y in terms of x into this equation:\n\n(y + z) / 2 = (420 - x - (160 - x)) / 2 = (260) / 2 = 130\n\nTherefore, the answer is e.\nAnswer: e",

In this case, m - 5a must be odd, so a must be even. Let a = 2k, where k is a positive integer. Then we have:\n\nb = (m - 10k) / 7\n\nSince b must be a positive integer, m - 10k must be a multiple of 7. The largest possible value of m for which only one pair of positive integer solutions exists is therefore the largest odd multiple of 7 that is less than 100:\n\nm = 7 x 13 = 91\n\n4. Check the answer: We can check that this value of m satisfies the conditions of the problem. For m = 91, the equation becomes:\n\n5a + 7b = 91\n\nThe only positive integer solution is a = 6, b = 5. No other pair of positive integer solutions exists.\n\nTherefore, the answer is a.\nAnswer: a",

Find the average mark: We can substitute the value of x into the equation for the average mark and simplify as follows:\n\nAverage mark = (3x + 170) / 4 = (3(47.5) + 170) / 4 = 65\n\nTherefore, the answer is b.\nAnswer: b",

We can use the Chinese remainder theorem to find this remainder:\n\nM \u2261 a (mod 2^15)\nM \u2261 b (mod 2^15)\n\nwhere a and b are the remainders when M is divided by 2^15 and 2^32, respectively. We can use the fact that M is not divisible by 2 to find a:\n\n50! = 2^47 * M \u2261 2^47 (mod 2^15)\n2^47 \u2261 2^15 * 2^32 \u2261 0 (mod 2^15)\nM \u2261 0 (mod 2^15)\n\nTherefore, the remainder when 50! is divided by 16^8 is 0.\n\nTherefore, the answer is a.\nAnswer: a",

Determine the possible values of n and m: We can use the possible values of the hundreds, tens, and units digits to determine the possible values of n and m. For example, if the hundreds digit of n is 2, then the hundreds digit of m must be 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7. We can continue this process for each possible value of the hundreds digit.\n\n5. Determine the smallest possible difference: We can determine the smallest possible difference between n and m by trying all possible combinations of n and m and finding the smallest difference. However, this would be a very time-consuming process. Instead, we can use some logic to narrow down the possibilities.\n\n- If the hundreds digit of n is 2, then the hundreds digit of m must be at least 3. Therefore, the smallest possible difference is at least 100.\n- If the hundreds digit of n is 3, then the hundreds digit of m must be at least 4. Therefore, the smallest possible difference is at least 100.\n- If the hundreds digit of n is 4, then the hundreds digit of m must be at least 5. Therefore, the smallest possible difference is at least 100.\n- If the hundreds digit of n is 5, then the hundreds digit of m must be at least 6. Therefore, the smallest possible difference is at least 100.\n- If the hundreds digit of n is 6, then the hundreds digit of m must be 7. Therefore, the smallest possible difference is 100 + (50 - 20) = 130.\n- If the hundreds digit of n is 7, then the hundreds digit of m must be 6. Therefore",

We know that 20% of the men and 40% of the women attended, so we can set up the following equation:\n\n0.2(2/5)M + 0.4(3/5)F = P\n\nSimplifying this equation using the ratio of male to female employees, we get:\n\n0.2(2/5)(3/5)F + 0.4(3/5)F = P\n0.24F = P\n\nTherefore, the percentage of all employees who attended the picnic is 24% (since F + M = 100%, and we know that M/F = 2/3, we can calculate that F = 60% and M = 40%, so P = 0.24 x 100% = 24%).\n\n4.

Since there are 12 hours on a clock face, each hour mark represents an angle of 360/12 = 30 degrees. Therefore, the hour hand is at an angle of 10 x 30 + 30/2 = 315 degrees.\n\n3. Determine the position of the minute hand: At 10:30, the minute hand is pointing directly at the 6 on the clock face.

Calculate the angle between the hands: The angle between the hands is the absolute difference between their positions.

Consider the possible remainders of n when divided by 12: Since n is a prime number greater than 5, it must be either 6k + 1 or 6k - 1 for some integer k. Therefore, the possible remainders of n when divided by 12 are 1 or 11.\n\n3. Square n and consider the possible remainders of n^2 when divided by 12: If n has a remainder of 1 when divided by 12, then n^2 has a remainder of 1 when divided by 12. If n has a remainder of 11 when divided by 12, then n^2 has a remainder of 1 when divided by 12 as well, since (11)^2 = 121 = 10(12) + 1.\n\n4.
