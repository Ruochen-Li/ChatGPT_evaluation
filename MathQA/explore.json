    "Problem": "each month a retailer sells 100 identical items . on each item he makes a profit of $ 40 that constitutes 10 % of the item ' s price to the retailer . if the retailer contemplates giving a 5 % discount on the items he sells , what is the least number of items he will have to sell each month to justify the policy of the discount ?",
    "Rationale": "\"for this question , we ' ll need the following formula : sell price = cost + profit we ' re told that the profit on 1 item is $ 20 and that this represents 10 % of the cost : sell price = cost + $ 40 sell price = $ 400 + $ 40 thus , the sell price is $ 440 for each item . selling all 100 items gives the retailer . . . 100 ( $ 40 ) = $ 2,000 of profit if the retailer offers a 5 % discount on the sell price , then the equation changes . . . 5 % ( 440 ) = $ 22 discount $ 418 = $ 400 + $ 18 now , the retailer makes a profit of just $ 18 per item sold . to earn $ 2,000 in profit , the retailer must sell . . . . $ 18 ( x ) = $ 2,000 x = 2,000 / 18 x = 222.222222 items you ' ll notice that this is not among the answer choices . . . . 221 and 223 are . selling 221 items would get us 9 ( 221 ) = $ 1989 which is not enough money . to get back to at least $ 2,000 , we need to sell 223 items . final answer : d\"",

    "predicted_rational": "1. Understand the problem: We are given that a retailer sells 100 identical items each month and makes a profit of $40 on each item, which is 10% of the item's price to the retailer. The retailer is contemplating giving a 5% discount on the items and we need to find the least number of items he will have to sell each month to justify the policy of the discount.\n\n2. Set up equations: Let the cost price of each item to the retailer be x. Then, the profit on each item is 0.1x and the selling price is (x + 0.1x) = 1.1x. If the retailer gives a 5% discount, the selling price will be (0.95)(1.1x) = 1.045x. We need to find the minimum number of items the retailer needs to sell to make the same profit with the discount as without the discount. Let N be the minimum number of items.\n\nProfit without discount = 100(0.1x) = 10x\nProfit with discount = N(1.045x - x) = 0.045Nx\n\nWe want the profit with discount to be equal to the profit without discount, so:\n\n0.045Nx = 10x\n\n3. Solve for N: We can simplify the equation as follows:\n\nN = 10x / 0.045x\nN = 222.22\n\nSince N has to be a whole number, the minimum number of items the retailer needs to sell each month to justify the policy of the discount is 223.\n\n4. Check the answer: We can verify that the profit with discount is equal to the profit without discount for N = 223:\n\nProfit without discount = 100(0.1x) = 10x\nProfit with discount = 223(1.045x - x) = 0.045(223)x = 10.035x\n\nTherefore, the answer is d.\nAnswer: d",
