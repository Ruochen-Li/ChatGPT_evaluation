We need to find the number of hours per day that 4 pumps must work to achieve this.\n\n2. Determine the rate of work: We can determine the rate of work per pump per hour by dividing the amount of work (emptying the tank) by the number of pumps and the number of hours:\n\nRate of work = 1 / (3 x 8 x 2) = 1 / 48\n\n3. Determine the amount of work to be done: We can determine the amount of work to be done (emptying the tank) based on the desired time:\n\nAmount of work = 1 / 1 = 1\n\n4. Determine the new rate of work: We can determine the new rate of work based on the desired time and the number of pumps:\n\nNew rate of work = 1 / (4 x h)\n\nwhere h is the number of hours per day that 4 pumps must work.\n\n5. Set up an equation: We can set up an equation based on the fact that the amount of work done must be the same in both cases:\n\nRate of work x Time = Amount of work\n\nUsing the rates of work from steps 2 and 4, we get:\n\n1/48 x 16 = 1 / (4 x h)\n\n6. Solve for h: We can simplify the equation as follows:\n\n1/3 = 1 / (4 x h)\n4 x h = 3\nh = 3/4\n\nTherefore, 4 pumps must work 3/4 hours per day, or 45 minutes per day, to empty the tank in 1 day.\n\n7. Convert to minutes: We can convert this to minutes per day by multiplying by 60:\n\n45 minutes per day = 0.75 hours per day = 45/60 hours per day\n\nTherefore, the answer is a.\n\nAnswer: a",
