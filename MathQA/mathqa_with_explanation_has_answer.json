To do this, we can try different values of L and see what value of W gives us the smallest possible L x W. For example, if we try L = 24, then we get W = 10, which gives us an area of (24-4) x (10-6) = 80 sq cm. If we try L = 30, then we get W = 8, which gives us an area of (30-4) x (8-6) = 52 sq cm. Continuing in this way, we can see that the smallest possible area is achieved when L = 18 and W = 14, which gives us an area of (18-4) x (14-6) = 112 sq cm. Therefore, the optimized size of the paper is 18 x 14 = 252 sq cm. None of the given options match this answer, so the correct answer is e) none of these.",

Adding those two numbers together, we get the total number of passengers with cars: 20-x+0.5(20-x) = 15-0.5x.

Now, we need to find the time it takes for the slower train to cross the faster train, which is the sum of the time it takes for the front of the slower train to pass the front of the faster train and the time it takes for the end of the slower train to pass the end of the faster train. Let's focus on the first part: the distance between the front of the slower train and the front of the faster train is the sum of their lengths, which is 1.10 km + 0.9 km = 2 km. Using the relative speed we found earlier, we can find the time it takes for the front of the slower train to pass the front of the faster train: 2 km / (5/12 km/s) = 24 seconds. Now, let's focus on the second part: the distance between the end of the slower train and the end of the faster train is again the sum of their lengths, which is 1.10 km + 0.9 km = 2 km. Using the same relative speed, we can find the time it takes for the end of the slower train to pass the end of the faster train: 2 km / (5/12 km/s) = 24 seconds.

So, in 4 days, they would have completed 4/10 or 2/5 of the work. \n\nNow, Tarun has left and Arun has to complete the remaining 3/5 of the work alone. We know that Arun can do the work alone in 50 days, so his rate is 1/50. Let's use the formula: \n\n(rate)(time) = work \n\n(1/50)(time) = 3/5 \n\nSolving for time, we get: \n\ntime = (3/5) * 50 = 30 \n\nSo, Arun will take 30 more days to complete the remaining work alone. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (d) 30 days.",

Then, 1.15y = 82.8, so y = 72. \n\nTherefore, the original weights of Ram and Shyam were 3x = 27 kg and 5x = 45 kg respectively. \n\nTo find the new weight of Shyam, we need to find what 15% of 72 is, which is 10.8. So, the new total weight is 72 + 10.8 = 82.8 kg. \n\nLet the new weight of Shyam be y. Then, we have:\n\n3.3x + y = 82.8\ny = 82.8 - 3.3x\n\nSubstituting x = 9 (from Ram's original weight), we get:\n\ny = 82.8 - 3.3(9) = 53.1\n\nSo, the new weight of Shyam is 53.1 kg, which is an increase of:\n\n(53.1 - 45)/45 * 100% = 18%\n\nTherefore, the answer is (a) 18%.",

Substituting this into the expression for x + y, we get: (x + y) + z = 160 + (x + 100) = 260 + x. \n\nTo find the average of y and z, we need to find (y + z)/2.

The average of y and z must be greater than 80 (since the average of x and y is 80 and z is greater than x), so we can eliminate choices B and C. \n\nTo determine whether the answer is A, D, or E, we need to know whether x is greater than, less than, or equal to 100. If x is equal to 100, then z is equal to 200 and the average of y and z is (y + z)/2 = (y + 200)/2. We know that the average of x and y is 80, so (x + y)/2 = 80, which means x + y = 160.

Plugging these values into the formula, we get: speed = 120/(12/3600) = 30*3600/12 = 9000/3 = 3000 m/h. Converting this to kmph, we get: speed = 3000/1000 * 60 * 60 = 10800/5 = 2160 kmph.

        "Problem": "4 shepherds were watching over the flocks and they were commenting on how many sheep they each had . if ram had 3 more sheep than he would have one less than rahul . wheras akar has the same number as the other 3 shepherds put togeher . if john had 3 less sheep he would have exactly trile the number of ram . if they were evenly distributed if they would each have 11 seep how many sheep did ram have ?",
        "Rationale": "akar has = ram + rahul + john after evenly distribution each has 11 . so , total no . is 44 so , akar has = 22 & ram + rahul + john = 22 also ram = rahul - 4 & john - 3 = 3 * ram solving these we get the sol . answer : b",

I'll use elimination:\n8R + 4B + 4C = 57\n-8R - 7B - 7C = -41\n---------------------\n-3B - 3C = 16\nB + C = -16/3 (which doesn't make sense, so there must be no solution)\n\nTherefore, there is no solution that satisfies all the given conditions.
