Question: average age of students of an adult school is 40 years . 120 new students whose average age is 32 years joined the school . as a result the average age is decreased by 4 years . find the number of students of the school after joining of the new students .
a ) 1200 , b ) 120 , c ) 360 , d ) 240 , e ) 180
Following what steps can we solve this problem?
1. Understand the problem: We are given the average age of students in an adult school and the average age decreases by 4 years when 120 new students join the school. We need to find the number of students in the school after the new students join.\n\n2. Set up equations: Let x be the number of students in the school before the new students join. Then, we can set up the following equation based on the given information:\n\n(40x + 32*120)/(x + 120) = 36\n\nThis equation represents the fact that the average age decreases by 4 years when the new students join.\n\n3. Solve for x: We can simplify the equation as follows:\n\n40x + 3840 = 36x + 4320\n4x = 480\nx = 120\n\nTherefore, there were 120 students in the school before the new students joined.\n\n4. Find the total number of students: We can find the total number of students after the new students join by adding the number of new students to the original number of students:\n\nTotal number of students = 120 + 120 = 240\n\nTherefore, the answer is d.
